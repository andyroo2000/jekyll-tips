Judging from the number of stars Jekyll has on Github, I'd say it has a decent following.

I created this site because I've had a hard time finding great articles on actually using Jekyll in production for real projects. There are certainly a few here and there, but I haven't found a single place that could be a trusted resource or the first place you check for information on how to do things in Jekyll.

I plan on writing a post a week, so it might take a little while for this to become a useful repository for all things Jekyll, but over time, I hope to amass a nice collection of clearly explained articles that might help others who have decided to take Jekyll beyond simply installing a default Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages.
